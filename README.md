# WeCommute-App
WeCommute is a transit app that currently services the NYC-Metro Area which includes the LIRR, Metro-North, and NJ Transit. Our app allows you the user to report delays and stay up to date with the state of service on your commute from work to home and vice versa.

## Why Use our app?
If you've ever taken any public transportation in New York City and surrounding areas it doesn't take long to figure out that it's very unpredictable and also the operating agency (The MTA) doesn't have an active social media presence or frequently updates commuters of issues. So we have given you the customer an outlet to actively update and receive issues in real time with commuting and also voice concerns or issues that we will send  weekly reports to the MTA to help push customer voices because you should be heard!
